# node-minimalistic-server
Minimalistic server library for Node.js. It supports routing, middlewares, parsing common request bodies (JSON, form data, etc), static file serving. 
In order to see how it works, you can download and run this [demo project](https://github.com/surenenfiajyan/files/raw/refs/heads/main/gallery.zip) (in the project root directory run `npm install` and then `npm start`).
